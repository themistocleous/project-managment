# Recording Procedures

## The Recorder
1.	Check that the memory card is inside the recorder and that it is not full (if it gets full during the recording phase, you will not notice it, as there is no warning.
2.	Battery or cable is available. Have extra batteries close to you, if you are using the recorder with batteries.
3.	Attach the tripod on the Zoom H4N.

## Setting
1.	***Distance from the microphone:*** This should be fixed at one foot from the mouth (for this, we will need a tripod). Variable distance from the microphone affects metrics, such as the intensity and the overall spectral properties and this is bad when comparing metrics and especially when analyzing consonants.
2.	***Noise Sensitivity:*** Set the sensitivity of the microphone at maximum 40 (if there is surrounding noise you can decrease it up to 25). This is the button with the [+] and [-] at the right side of the recorder.
3.	***Room***: When/if possible use the same room for the recordings. Different rooms affect the overall recording quality.

## After Therapy/Evaluation
1.	Copy the recordings from the Zoom's memory card to the laptop and delete the sounds from the Zoom's memory card.
2.	Use the naming conventions to rename the sounds files and move them to the folder with the other materials of the speaker.

## Notes
- If for some reason, there is a problem with the Zoom H4N or if we need to conduct two recordings at the same time, you should use the Zoom H2N. Do not use the other recorders. s
